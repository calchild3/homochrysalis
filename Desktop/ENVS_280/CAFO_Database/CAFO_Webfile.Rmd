###Environmental Injustice and Industrial Animal Agriculture: Geospatial Examination of CAFOs Across County, Income, and Race

###Background

Numerous studies have suggested that Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations are disproportionately located in low income, and/or minority communities. I am interested in looking at data for top 5 states that produce "livestock units" across three animal species (cattle, hogs, chickens) that dominate domestic industrial animal agriculture. 

I am sourcing data from [Data for a Cause, 2017](https://data.world/dataforacause/concentrated-animal-feeding-operations-cafo "Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO), US, Data.world"), as well as from 
[United States Department of Agriculture, 2017](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/#8BFBF75E-B877-3245-AFCC-B00D4B1BE1BF "Quickstats, Cattle Inventory Across State, USDA").

My intention is to first sort the values of inventory of each "commodity" (cattle, hogs, chickens) in descending order to determine which top 5 states produce the most of each type of animal. From here, I hope to survey the counties within each of these 5 states that yield the highest inventory. From here, I will tie in data from the [US Census Bureau, 2017](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t#none "United States Census Bureau") to look at race and class demographics of these counties.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cattle_cafo.dat <- read_csv('data/cattle_inventory_state.csv')
cattle_cafo.dat1 <- select(cattle_cafo.dat, Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity)

read_csv('data/cattle_inventory_state.csv') %>%
  select(Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity) %>%
  mutate(Value = as.numeric(gsub(',', '', Value))) %>%
  arrange(desc(Value)) %>%
  head(cattle_cafo.dat1, 10)
``` 

From these results, we can see that Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Nebraska have the highest inventory for cattle in animal agriculture. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hogs_cafo.dat <- read_csv('data/hogs_inventory_state.csv') 
hogs_cafo.dat1 <- select(hogs_cafo.dat, Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity)

read_csv('data/hogs_inventory_state.csv') %>%
  select(Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity) %>%
  mutate(Value = as.numeric(gsub(',', '', Value))) %>%
  arrange(desc(Value))
```

From these results, we can see that Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, Indiana, and Illinois have the highest inventory for hogs in animal agriculture. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
chickens_cafo.dat <- read_csv('data/chickens_inventory_state.csv') 
view(chickens_cafo.dat)
chickens_cafo.dat1 <- select(chickens_cafo.dat, Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity)
tbl_df(chickens_cafo.dat1)


read_csv('data/chickens_inventory_state.csv') %>%
  select(Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity) %>%
  mutate(Value = as.numeric(gsub(',', '', Value))) %>%
  arrange(desc(Value)) %>%
  head == 10

ggplot(chickens_cafo.dat1, 
```

library(tidyverse)
hogs_georgia_county_cafo.dat <- read_csv('data/chickens_inventory_state.csv') 
hogs_georgia_county_cafo.dat1 <- select(chickens_cafo.dat, Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity)

read_csv('data/chickens_inventory_state.csv') %>%
  select(Program, Year, Value, State, Commodity) %>%
  mutate(Value = as.numeric(gsub(',', '', Value))) %>%
  arrange(desc(Value))

From these results, we can see that Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Mississippi have the highest inventory for chickens in animal agriculture. 

I intend to examine the particular counties within these top 5 states in each animal group that hold the highest concentrations of inventories, and from there, I hope to assess the race and class demographics of each county or possibly, zip code, through the data from the Census Bureau. Thank you!
